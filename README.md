# About Diverting Game（Tic-Tac-Toe）

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and popular strategy board game that is typically played by two players. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and players take turns placing their respective markers on empty squares with the goal of forming a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Game Rules

1. The Tic-Tac-Toe board is a 3x3 grid with a total of 9 positions for players to place their markers.
2. Player 1 uses "X" as their marker, and Player 2 uses "O".
3. The game starts with an empty board, and Player 1 goes first.
4. Each player takes turns selecting an empty square and placing their marker on that position.
5. Players try to form a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game.
6. If the board becomes full and no player has formed a line, the game ends in a draw.
7. If any player successfully forms a line, they win the game.
8. The game can be restarted once it is finished.
 

That concludes the introduction to Tic-Tac-Toe. Have fun playing this exciting game!
