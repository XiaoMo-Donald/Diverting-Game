                <p className={`${styles.mb54} ${styles.content} about-content`}>Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and popular strategy board game that is typically played by two players. The game board consists of a 3x3
                    grid,
                    and players take turns placing their respective markers on empty squares with the goal of forming a line horizontally, vertically,
                    or
                    diagonally.</p>

                    <li>The Tic-Tac-Toe board is a 3x3 grid with a total of 9 positions for players to place their markers.</li>
                    <li>Player 1 uses "X" as their marker, and Player 2 uses "O".</li>
                    <li>The game starts with an empty board, and Player 1 goes first.</li>
                    <li>Each player takes turns selecting an empty square and placing their marker on that position.</li>
                    <li>Players try to form a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game.</li>
                    <li>If the board becomes full and no player has formed a line, the game ends in a draw.</li>
                    <li>If any player successfully forms a line, they win the game.</li>
                    <li>The game can be restarted once it is finished.</li>
